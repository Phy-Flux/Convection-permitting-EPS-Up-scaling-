- The pyscaling package contain ALL_IN file, which is a Python script to implement three different types of Up-scaling and a Gaussian filter.
Specifically designed to produce blurring and smoothing effect on a probability-like domain for Ensemble Prediction Models of precipitation, but also for temperature, humidity, or other meteorological scalar fields if needed.

Download pyscaling and import it as a normal python package.

- The Station_Data_Search file uses the ALL_IN functions for a trial test.
